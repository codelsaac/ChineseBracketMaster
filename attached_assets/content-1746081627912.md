### HTML

#### HTML Preprocessor

##### About HTML Preprocessors

HTML preprocessors can make writing HTML more powerful or convenient. For instance, Markdown is designed to be easier to write and read for text documents and you could write a loop in Pug.

#### Add Class(es) to <html>

##### Adding Classes

In CodePen, whatever you write in the HTML editor is what goes within the `<body>` tags in [a basic HTML5 template](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/preview-template/). So you don't have access to higher-up elements like the `<html>` tag. If you want to add classes there that can affect the whole document, this is the place to do it.

#### Stuff for <head>

##### About the <head>

In CodePen, whatever you write in the HTML editor is what goes within the `<body>` tags in [a basic HTML5 template](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/preview-template/). If you need things in the `<head>` of the document, put that code here.

##### Insecure Resource

The resource you are linking to is using the 'http' protocol, which may not work when the browser is using https.

### CSS

#### CSS Preprocessor

##### About CSS Preprocessors

CSS preprocessors help make authoring CSS easier. All of them offer things like variables and mixins to provide convenient abstractions.

#### CSS Base

##### About CSS Base

It's a common practice to apply CSS to a page that styles elements such that they are consistent across all browsers. We offer two of the most popular choices: [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and a [reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/). Or, choose **Neither** and nothing will be applied.

- Normalize
- Reset
- Neither

#### Vendor Prefixing

##### About Vendor Prefixing

To get the best cross-browser support, it is a common practice to apply vendor prefixes to CSS properties and values that require them to work. For instance `-webkit-` or `-moz-`.

We offer two popular choices: [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) (which processes your CSS server-side) and [-prefix-free](http://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree/) (which applies prefixes via a script, client-side).

- Autoprefixer
- Prefixfree
- Neither

#### Add External Stylesheets/Pens

Any URLs added here will be added as `<link>` s in order, and before the CSS in the editor. You can use the CSS from another Pen by using its URL and the proper [URL extension](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/url-extensions/).

```

```

##### About External Resources

You can apply CSS to your Pen from any stylesheet on the web. Just put a URL to it here and we'll apply it, in the order you have them, before the CSS in the Pen itself.

You can also link to another Pen here (use the `.css` [URL Extension](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/url-extensions/)) and we'll pull the CSS from that Pen and include it. If it's using a _matching_ preprocessor, use the appropriate URL Extension and we'll combine the code before preprocessing, so you can use the linked Pen as a true dependency.

##### Insecure Resource

You are linking to a resource using the non-secure http:// protocol, which may not work when the browser is using https:// like CodePen enforces.

?

##### URL Extension Required

When linking another Pen as a resource, make sure you use a [URL Extension](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/url-extensions/) of the type of code you want to link to. Either `.css`, `.js`, or the extension of a matching code processor.

### JavaScript

##### About JavaScript Preprocessors

JavaScript preprocessors can help make authoring JavaScript easier and more convenient.

NoneBabelTypeScriptCoffeeScriptLiveScript

Babel includes JSX processing.

#### Add External Scripts/Pens

Any URL's added here will be added as `<script>` s in order, and run _before_ the JavaScript in the editor. You can use the URL of any other Pen and it will include the JavaScript from that Pen.

```

```

##### About External Resources

You can apply a script from anywhere on the web to your Pen. Just put a URL to it here and we'll add it, in the order you have them, before the JavaScript in the Pen itself.

If the script you link to has the file extension of a preprocessor, we'll attempt to process it before applying.

You can also link to another Pen here, and we'll pull the JavaScript from that Pen and include it. If it's using a matching preprocessor, we'll combine the code before preprocessing, so you can use the linked Pen as a true dependency.

### Packages

#### Add Packages

Search for and use JavaScript packages from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) here. By selecting a package, an `import` statement will be added to the top of the JavaScript editor for this package.

```

```

[Powered by ![Algolia](https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/settings/algolia-9e1c0c887f4db420704b2a79926864019ef156bcecc9d5774a7e4eaa731fc5b5.svg)](https://www.algolia.com/?utm_source=react-instantsearch&utm_medium=website&utm_content=codepen.io&utm_campaign=poweredby)

##### About Packages

Using packages here is powered by [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/), which makes packages from npm not only available on a CDN, but prepares them for native JavaScript ESM usage.

All packages are different, so refer to their docs for how they work.

If you're using React / ReactDOM, make sure to turn on Babel for the JSX processing.

### Behavior

#### Auto Save

If active, Pens will autosave every 30 seconds after being saved once.

#### Auto-Updating Preview

If enabled, the preview panel updates automatically as you code. If disabled, use the "Run" button to update.

#### Format on Save

If enabled, your code will be formatted when you actively save your Pen. **Note: your code becomes un-folded during formatting.**

### Editor Settings

#### Code Indentation

- Spaces
- Tabs

#### Code Indent width
